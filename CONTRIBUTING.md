# Contributing to MCP Astronomical Time Server

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-astronomical-time-server.git
cd mcp-astronomical-time-server

# Install dependencies
npm install
